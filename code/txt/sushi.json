I like the variety in the menu and the presentation of the food was a nice amenity. I was a little disappointed with the ambiance. Not a bad thing I thought it would be a little bit more lively and crowded but instead of it was more quiet than I thought. Which wasn&#39;t a bad thing since my friend and I didn&#39;t have to wait for a table and could hear each other talk. Overall I would recommend this place but I little bit overrated I thought reading from the other reviewers."

      "LastReviewIntro": "My friends and I have been to Blowfish probably 100 times in the past 7 years. I live 1 block away. It was convenient and the sushi is good. We always tolerated the bad service and the attitude. Of the 100 times we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve probably had good service 20% of the time. Despite the frequency of our patronage we rarely got recognized by the staff and OFTEN waited 20-25 minutes (or more) for drink orders the check etc... and the attitude and aloofness was palpable. The last time I went I sat at the bar and a male bartender clearly seemed annoyed with us for no reason at all. We begged for drinks opened our own Sake bottle (not twist off - corkscrew) and were pretty much ignored all night long - right down to waiting FOREVER for our bill. I told my friends &quot;this is the last time....&quot; It&#39;s embarrassing to bring in guests from out of town. I eat out 99% of the time and they have the worst service I have ever consistently experienced.Do yourself a favor go to nearby Live Sushi Bar or Sushi Bistro and be waited on by people who smile with no attitude. The sushi at both places is excellent too.and Blowfish...get over yourself.don&#39;t don&#39;t don&#39;t don&#39;t...don&#39;t believe the hype.....Chris B"

(the lines are long). first a warning: you can wait up to 2hrs to get in here (my friends say in all sincerity). well I went for the 3rd time last thursday and there was no wait but the waitress broke a glass and I found a glass chip by my sushi roll! it kinda freaked me out. so ah I am giving them 3 stars only because I pointed out the glass chip and the waitress basically said &quot;so what&quot; ! ha. VERY nice sushi maker guy though..."

We ordered a starter -tuna tar tar spicy salmon sushi uni sushibeef teriyaki (medium rare) w/ sashimi. The restaurant was so busy that our food came after a 20 min. wait.What&#39;s worst is they first served a well done beef teriyaki with rice. Then after following up our other orders bec another 10 mins passed they served the sashimi and sushi. The uni sushi was great but the spicy salmon was not a bit spicy.I was disappointed. The last order that arrived was our starter-the tuna tar tar. Overall we did not have a good experience with this restaurant with such high reviews."
